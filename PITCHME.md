- All-round real-time monitoring:
	Provides monitoring capabilities from a variety of perspectives. Minute to second level monitoring, high reliability, high timeliness, and low latency.

- Flexible alarm rules:
	According to business characteristics, time period, and degree of importance, so as to achieve no false positives or omissions.

- Simple management:
	Millions of equipment monitoring and deployment capabilities of minutes, automatic recovery of failures, cluster scalability

- Custom and convenient configuration:
	Rich custom product configuration features, convenient and efficient completion of product configuration, alarm configuration.

- Visualization:
	Rich visual Dashboard helps you customize personalized surveillance market.

- Low resource consumption:
	Guarantees a very low occupancy rate of resources such as the CPU and memory of the host.

- Storage:
